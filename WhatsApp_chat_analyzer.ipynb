Those who wish to continue their studies from abroad for a limited period of one semester should arrange this by submitting the following documents to the Graduate School via the Graduate School Secretary of their academic unit (this can also be done from abroad): • A letter of request, including reference to timetables and research milestones.  • Advisor's recommendation and confirmation that the research may be continued temporarily while abroad. • For Master's students who are required to take courses – Advisor's approval and Vice Dean approval regarding a feasible possibility for course studies from abroad, or alternatively, submission of a study program that does not include courses during 2023-24 Winter semester. • Advisor's and Vice Dean's recommendation for awarding a scholarship for the period abroad (if there is an intention to award it). Alternatively, one can request to hold the scholarship payments, or request an academic leave for the entire 2023-24 Winter semester. Such requests will be submitted through the department using the usual protocol and will be processed as quickly as possible. Due to the situation, the restrictions that normally apply to academic leave approvals will be reconsidered. It is important to note that the procedures appearing in this section refer to active students who have already begun their studies. The possibility of aadjusting and applying them to new students who are supposed to begin their studies in the winter semester 2023/2024 but are currently abroad is being examined. Guidelines regarding this option it will be published in the coming days.\n",

      "First, the Technion Indians group is a not just a place to send information. It is a group that was started to have a place to support each other. Support each other because we all are on the same page. That we have left our homes behind and have made new relations in a foreign country. I think many people will agree that the Technion is among very few institution in the world where the Indian student population is very dense. And this gives us an advantage to live like one large family. So, let us remember this advantage and also remember that everybody here is to help each each other. \n",
      "The help and care we have for each was undoubtedly shown since the evacuation flights started. It was possible because this group stayed true to its purpose of “Technion Indians”. We worked like ONE UNIT one FAMILY. \n",
      "Secondly, it is not the first time that the group has faced problems because of political arguments. \n",
      "These arguments have always ended with a bad feeling for those directly involved and other members of the group. \n",
