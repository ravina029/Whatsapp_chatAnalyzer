[24/07/2022, 10:44:37 PM] ~ Kartick Dey: If it is continuously off for last few days/weeks, you may need to replace the SIM. Same happened with me(Airtel)... After replacing it is working fine

And when it shows multiple operators try to select a partner with 2G/3G ... If sim and recharge and everything else is fine.. doing it mostly works for me... Network keeps on vanishing now and then during the month and I always try this in settings first.... Might be helpful

[25/07/2022, 1:28:20 PM] ~ Chandra Shekhar Pant: Hello, kind attention to students who have stayed more than 3 years ( as a postdoc student), might have or at the brink of losing the discounted/concessional bank account status. Discounted/concessional/student bank accounts here refer to the exempted transactional fees. This is my experience today at Bank of Hapoalim (my bank account opened at the start of July). To extend that student account you need to give the bank some proof, that you are still a student.

[25/07/2022, 6:42:32 PM] ~ Arghyadeep Basu: They did it automatically. You have to pay 175 nis for multiple entry.
[25/07/2022, 6:43:35 PM] ~ Akshay: 175 shekels A2 visa extension for an year?
[25/07/2022, 6:43:41 PM] ~ Akshay: shekels for*
[25/07/2022, 6:44:58 PM] ~ Arghyadeep Basu: No 6 month

[25/07/2022, 6:45:36 PM] ~ PACKIYARAJ: Now they are charging 180 INS.
[25/07/2022, 6:46:07 PM] ~ Arghyadeep Basu: You don’t have to pay anything if you don’t want to have a multiple entry. 6 month extension is free.
[25/07/2022, 6:46:12 PM] ~ Sumana: R u sure? I paid 175 nis for single entry 1 Yr once. U need to pay 175 x2 nis for multiple for a Yr as far i know
[25/07/2022, 6:47:30 PM] ~ Arghyadeep Basu: But now they are not issuing visa for one year.
[25/07/2022, 6:47:50 PM] ~ Sumana: If you are not going out of Israel then u don't need. But if ur visa has expired n u want to  go out of Israel n come back then u need to get ur visa
[25/07/2022, 6:48:08 PM] ~ Arghyadeep Basu: Yup .
[25/07/2022, 6:48:21 PM] ~ Sumana: Then they might have changed the rules
[25/07/2022, 6:49:21 PM] ~ Sumana: Earlier they used give either 1 Yr or till the date of your tenure in the university
[25/07/2022, 7:42:11 PM] ~ Anuj Bisht: What they mean by automatic visa extension is that u can stay with same visa without going out of Israel and getting new one from MOI. If u anyway got here to get new visa, even single entry, they will charge you
[25/07/2022, 7:53:35 PM] ~ SugiAadish: If it's automatic, should one carry all the documents and appear Infront of the ministry?

[30/08/2022, 1:46:35 PM] ~ Morningstar: We don’t need transit visa if we don’t go out of the airport
[30/08/2022, 1:51:19 PM] ~ Rohith Polisetty: I had layover at Dubai around 7 hrs with flydubai. I didn't need any transit visa as i stayed inside airport itself. But abu dabhi is different case. u mentioned dubai only right? Then there should not be any problem
both flights booked in Eithad Airways from TLV to dubai and Dubai-India right?
[30/08/2022, 1:57:54 PM] ~ Ashwini Krishna: Yes
[30/08/2022, 1:58:22 PM] ~ Ashwini Krishna: This was explained and yet the airways didn't allow him
[30/08/2022, 2:03:12 PM] ~ RK: When I came to israel in Etihad,  the layover was for 2 hours in Abudhabi, no transit visa was required as I remained in the airport during this time. 

Has there been any change in rule or something ??
[30/08/2022, 2:09:17 PM] ~ Ashwini Krishna: I think it is because of Etihad from TLV-AUH and Indigo from AUH-Delhi

[30/08/2022, 2:10:35 PM] ~ Suraj Krishna M S: If it is just Etihad, you don't need a transit visa. This might be different as perhaps he has to collect his baggage and check them in again. This might need going through immigration counters.

[01/11/2022, 4:20:06 PM] ~ Labanya Bhattacharya: Hello all, I need to keep my vodafone SIM active to receive OTP. Which roaming plan will be best? Should I port to Airtel? Is Airtel service far better than Vodafone in such cases?
Thanks in advance,
Labanya
[01/11/2022, 4:22:42 PM] ~ Lakhanlal: I am using Airtel. It's ok. Although you need to keep doing some recharge every month in order to keep getting the messages. Otherwise they shut all the incoming. Perhaps if you port to Jio you don't need to recharge every month although I am not sure.
[01/11/2022, 4:24:30 PM] ~ Labanya Bhattacharya: I am a prepaid user. Thats mean one need to keep balance in his/her account.
[01/11/2022, 4:27:08 PM] ~ Lakhanlal: No you don't need to keep any balance. You just need to activate international roaming. With your monthly reacharges (on airtel 99 per month), you will get the incoming messages free. Although in order to send messages or to make/receive calls you need to keep some balance which no body does.

[04/11/2022, 3:38:04 PM] Jainik Technion India: Hello, does Maccabi insurance provide you with a free medical checkup in the Technion clinic? I know Clalit insurance does, but I am planning on switching to Maccabi insurance and this service is an important factor  in making decisions.

Did someone tried both Clalit and Maccabi insurance and can tell me which one is better in terms of services.

With Clalit I often face issues with getting medicine from Superpharma as most locations do not have contracts with Clalit and they charge money for basic medicines which should be free as they are included in the policy list. The only Superpharma store that I know is in horev centre, that has a contract with Clalit but is a bit far from technion.

I am under 24 years so Maccabi plans are cheaper for me, but I want to hear your suggestions about the services that I will gain and lose if I switch.

Thank you.

"INFO: *Please do not use DD cargo (https://www.dd-cargo.com/) to ship your stuff from Israel to India*. I was a student at Bar Ilan and sent a box to Kolkata from Tel Aviv, in January. The box has not yet arrived and probably never will. The people at the company often do not respond, and when they do, they make up weird excuses like customs clearance charges have increased and hence we have to wait, or that the parcel is being shipped back to Israel and needs to be shipped again. Eventually they stopped responding after late September. 

There are multiple people complaining in their FB page, but those comments get deleted quickly. So it isn't a one-off situation with me, it is a common occurrence. Hence avoid this company and please spread this message to other Indian groups in Israel warning them.

[08/02/2023, 4:52:44 PM] ~ Samrat Chakraborty: Hello all. I am planning to come to Israel at the beginning of March. I got to know that March 6-8 is public holiday in Israel and most probably public transport will be closed.
In this scenario when will it be convenient to book flight for israel.. 5th of March( just before holiday) or 9th of March( just after holiday)?
Since I've heard that in israel holidays are observed from evening to evening
[08/02/2023, 4:56:42 PM] ~ Akshay: Both 5th and 9th should be okay
[08/02/2023, 4:57:02 PM] ~ Akshay: And i guess the transport will start by 8th evening.
[08/02/2023, 4:57:18 PM] ~ K Rajesh: Hi All
Myself Rajesh and I am going to register PhD in Electrical department
[08/02/2023, 4:59:00 PM] ~ Samrat Chakraborty: Thanks.
If anyone else can highlight on this..will be appreciable
[08/02/2023, 5:00:24 PM] ~ Akshay: And what else u can do is u can share the transport with pre booked cab as an option. U can share the cost with one more person. It should be 200-250 NIS per head.
[08/02/2023, 5:03:18 PM] ~ Samrat Chakraborty: Thanks for the suggestion. I hope cabs will be available from the airport
[08/02/2023, 5:03:29 PM] ~ Akshay: Will always be
[08/02/2023, 5:04:17 PM] ~ Samrat Chakraborty: Do airport cabs usually accept in dollars. Since I'll not be coming with shekel and conversion rates are quite high in airports
[08/02/2023, 5:06:34 PM] ~ Akshay: No matter a public holiday.
[08/02/2023, 5:06:37 PM] ~ Akshay: And better try to pre-book it if u can. So that u don't waste ur time over there arguing about the prices.
[08/02/2023, 5:06:40 PM] ~ Akshay: On the contrary i guess the airport exchange rates at TLV airport are really good.
[08/02/2023, 5:06:42 PM] ~ Akshay: They won't accept dollars* only NIS.
[08/02/2023, 5:07:33 PM] ~ Samrat Chakraborty: And how can I pre book the cab before landing there. Could you please tell me
‎[08/02/2023, 5:07:48 PM] ~ Akshay: ‎Contact card omitted

Unfortunately, we couldn't make video of that incident.

[11/05/2023, 8:40:41 AM] ~ Akshay: Yesterday there was a post doc ( Neither I know his name nor his dept). I was being given the responsibility to handover the Indian flag to one of the flash mob girls, and also being asked not to use the flag for any other purpose. Meanwhile he asked me to let her small daughter handle it for sometime to which I had politely refused. After my first refusal, you seemed to be upset. I am extremely sorry for that, neither the Indian flag was my personal property nor I was supposed to say no to anyone. It was just some of the stuffs being handed over to us by embassy and I was being strictly asked to not let go off it (only meant for dance purpose). So whosoever that senior person is, I am sorry once again.
[11/05/2023, 8:41:32 AM] ~ Akshay: Initially I didn't know about the flag handover restriction policy, but after sometime I was being told about it. So please don't get offended.

[23/05/2023, 11:01:02 AM] ~ Shiladitya Laskar: Hello everyone.
This message may be bit late and repetitive.
 
I want to congratulate every volunteer for the completion of INDIA EXPO 2023. One of the way I want to congratulate them is by acknowledging them at Indian groups.

The list is a long one, I am bit brief here.

INDIA EXPO was sponsored by Indian embassy and Dean of students Technion 

INDIA EXPO was organized by 

Communication Team= Smriti and Navdeep.

Logistics Team= Jostin, Rohit Polisetty, and Navdeep. <supported by Ankit Shah, Arpan, Aman, Srijan and Mohit>

 Cultural Team= Smriti, Sucheta, and Rutvija< photobooth= Ankita, Pratibha and Simran>

Artist hospitality= Pallavi and Smriti.

Advertisement and Digital strategy= Sriman, Pratibha, Arpan and Shila
<info desk: Labanya and Prince>

The event was visualized by above, but was made successful by our too long list of volunteers and participants.

 We had confirmed 20 volunteers. We will continue bonding on our watsap group.

 These included info desk team, food management team, cultural team, crowd control etc. 

 A special regards to participants of FLASHMOB. It was a trend setter.

India expo 2023 is a small testimony that good quality Indian events are possible in Technion

This is Harischandra, going to be a student at Technion. 
I want to apply for A2 student visa at Delhi. But, I am not having my Date of birth certificate. Could you please let me know any alternative certificate i can submit to get the Visa.

Any leads will be highly appreciated.

Thank you in advance.
[27/05/2023, 11:06:03 AM] ~ Akshay: Apostille*
[27/05/2023, 11:06:40 AM] ~ Akshay: Issues by MEA. There are specific agents which can do the entire process and give u the certificate, or u can do it urself through MEA.

You are not a minor that you need to show your birth certificate to the Israeli Embassy.
Date of birth is mentioned on your passport.  Isn't this enough?
If this is not enough, are they trying to challenge the authenticity of Indian government ?
If an IVP still asks you for your birth certificate, teach them this lesson.
[27/05/2023, 11:34:07 AM] ~ Harischandra: Thank you for your information.
[27/05/2023, 11:37:09 AM] ~ Baja: Wish you all the best for your VISA application!

I went to Mumbai office
[27/05/2023, 11:43:23 AM] ~ Harischandra: Thank you. In my case i have to visit Delhi only for the visa. I am hoping it would go smoothly without DOB.
[27/05/2023, 11:44:05 AM] ~ Aneek: Carry the 10th admit with you. That is enough
[27/05/2023, 11:49:10 AM] ~ Ashwini Krishna: As mentioned by @919199223696 , your 10th marks card is good enough. You can mention in the visa cover letter that you don't have a birth certificate.

However, if you are still afraid, you can carry other related documents. 

FYI: I got A/2 VISA from Delhi
and my wife recently got A4 VISA from Delhi.  We didn't need to show any documents (except our passports) as a proof of DOB.

If you want to go to ER, then you need a doctor referral.

[27/07/2023, 12:21:12 PM] ~ Sayantan Maity: So, I request that person to DM me. I will let him contact my labmate (who is not in this group), and they will approach together to the German embassy
[27/07/2023, 12:22:28 PM] ~ Ashwini Krishna: Maybe that guy is me.. I couldn't get the appointment and the VFS website had some issues. I went directly to the VFS office and I had all the documents, so I could submit without any hassle

[18/08/2023, 12:30:46 AM] ~ Lakhanlal: It's recommended to apply before 15 days of travel. I got my Vienna visa after 14 days of submitting my application. Although you can always give a try and request the embassy.
[18/08/2023, 12:32:23 AM] Pallavi: Would it be fine if I am applying for visa in different country just because of early available appointment?
[18/08/2023, 12:33:35 AM] ~ Lakhanlal: Are you going for personal tour or for your scientific work?
[18/08/2023, 12:33:50 AM] ~ Lakhanlal: For personal tour, you can do that
[18/08/2023, 12:33:56 AM] Pallavi: Conference
[18/08/2023, 10:37:21 AM] Pallavi: Hello all, 
Do I need to take separate travel medical insurance for Schengen visa (I assume clalit is only for Israel), if yes    it would be nice if link can be shared.

[18/08/2023, 11:33:22 AM] ~ Nivedita: You can also call up Einat (Clalit technion representative) and she can give you the form for clalit travel insurance as well.
[18/08/2023, 2:35:18 PM] ~ Sainath: Clalit is very expensive. You can find cheaper alternatives online ( visitors coverage etc) especially for Europe
[18/08/2023, 2:46:36 PM] ~ Lakhanlal: I bought travel cum health insurance from Tata aig
[18/08/2023, 2:46:42 PM] ~ Lakhanlal: Which is much cheaper

[20/08/2023, 3:24:37 PM] ~ PACKIYARAJ: Hi. Recently, anyone has extended their visa? Is it possible to extend visa one month earlier?

[24/08/2023, 9:09:19 AM] ~ Ankit: It is us patent...but they are telling me a lot of rules...
[24/08/2023, 9:09:46 AM] ~ Mohit: Yes there are a lot of rules for foreigners here.
[24/08/2023, 9:10:25 AM] ~ Ankit: Let me know if someone went through all the procedures. Thanks
[24/08/2023, 9:10:30 AM] ~ Mohit: But why do you care, let your Professor deal.
[24/08/2023, 9:11:01 AM] ~ Ankit: He got emails about all those rules
[24/08/2023, 9:11:19 AM] ~ Ankit: According to Indian patent act section 39, no person residing in India shall make or cause to be made any patent application outside India, unless a patent application for the same invention has already been filed in India, and not less than six weeks have passed. If an inventor wishes to file outside India without filing first in India, the inventor must first obtain a foreign filing license from the India Patent Office.

 

The definition for assessing if the individual would be considered as Resident of India or otherwise:

 

1. Stay in India for a year is 182 days or more (the year would the financial year in which the first Application is being filed) or

 

2. Stay in India for the immediately 4 preceding financial years is 365 days or more and 60 days or more in the relevant financial year.

 

 

The Documentary Requirement for procuring Foreign Filing License:

·  Title of the invention.

·  Countries in which the proposed applications are to be filed (we usually mention all PCT member countries and all convention countries by default).

·  Name, Address and nationality of the assignee, if any.

·  Name, address and nationality of the Indian inventors (along with their Indian Addresses).

·  Power of Attorney from the Indian inventors mentioning their Indian address (simple signatures needed, legalization/ notarization not needed). We attach hereby our blank template of POA, please fill in the name and address (complete Indian Address with CITY, STATE,COUNTRY and PIN CODE) and get the same executed with handwritten signatures. No legalization/notarization required.

·  Name, address and nationality of any non-Indian inventors.

·  Complete specification (we may file as much information as is available, preferably if claims and drawings are available, the same should be filed to expedite the process).

 

We also received a cost estimate for obtaining foreign filing license of about EURO 450 – associate charges. The Indian patent office is required to response within 21 days.

[29/08/2023, 10:40:54 AM] ~ Sam: Sort of. But if everything in your profile is normal and fine, you should get 10 years.

For extension of student visa by one year including multiple entries, do we have to take any documents like the ones provided by Michal (until last year it used to be like this)
No she is saying just to go there and pay, no documents needed to carry with us to the MOI office. Can someone please share any recent information in this regard?
Thanks!
[29/08/2023, 2:35:55 PM] ~ Akshay: Now she is saying*
[29/08/2023, 2:43:11 PM] ~ Yogendra Kumar: I did last month, no need any documents .
[29/08/2023, 2:59:53 PM] Jostin: If your visa is expired, they will give multiple entry visa till 31st Jan 2024 without the document provided by Michal.
If you need 1year extension, you need to provide the documents.
[29/08/2023, 3:06:23 PM] ~ Akshay: Multiple entries??
[29/08/2023, 3:10:37 PM] ~ Yogendra Kumar: Yes, but you will get multiple entries till when you have visa. Not for one year and you will pay 185 nis. Like your visa expires after December so you only get multiple entries till December.

However, as the political beliefs may vary from person to person, and to respect each others political views, this group has been been political neutral so far, with main aim for helping/advising each other. 
Feel free to create another platform, specifically for sharing and exchanging political views. As myself included, interested in joining the platform and exchange my political perspectives.

Technion Update Concerning the Recent Events in the South
Saturday, 7th October 2023, 18:00
Dear Members of the Technion Community,
Early this morning, Israel entered a state of conflict. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims' families, the inhabitants of southern Israel, and our defense forces.
The Technion administration is vigilantly monitoring the evolving situation and preparing for multiple contingencies. Campus shelters are now accessible, and a situation room has been established to oversee developments.
As of now, the Home Front Command has issued no specific directives for the Haifa region. We continue our operations as usual, exercising appropriate caution.
Please note the following crucial announcements:
• Based on the Home Front Command's guidance, activities at the Technion campuses in Haifa will resume as usual tomorrow. However, the Sarona campus in Tel Aviv will remain closed.
• The second period (Moed B) exams of the spring semester and the first period (Moed A) exams of the summer semester, originally scheduled from Sunday, 8th October 2023, through Friday, 13th October 2023, will be postponed. An updated exam timetable will be released by the Office of Undergraduate Studies. Rescheduled dates will fall within the initial two weeks of the semester, set for afternoons and Fridays.
• A significant number of students have been mobilized for reserve duty. We stand ready to provide them with all necessary support.
• In light of a marked uptick in cyber-attack warnings, and in collaboration with the National Cyber Directorate and peer academic institutions, the security of the Technion’s systems has been enhanced. Users outside Israel may encounter intermittent disruptions.
• The Security Unit’s hotline operates around the clock at 04-8292222. More details can be found at https://bitahon.technion.ac.il.
• The Dean of Students Office remains available to assist. For any concerns, please reach out to:
Adih@technion.ac.il
counseling-director@technion.ac.il
We urge everyone to closely follow and adhere to updates and guidelines disseminated via email, WhatsApp, the Technion website, and our social media platforms.
[07/10/2023, 8:49:48 PM] Rutvija: Please be aware that during this national state of emergency, support services are available for non-Hebrew speakers. The Ministry of Aliyah and Immigration in association with ERAN operates an anonymous emergency psychological support hotline in the languages Russian, Amharic, English, French and Spanish.

[09/10/2023, 2:46:59 PM] ~ Addy: Yeah but mine got expired in September itself, so I am unsure if that is included in this extension or not
[09/10/2023, 3:06:28 PM] ~ Akshay: Mine too expired on September 4th, but a single entry visa was by default extended for next 6 months. I guess this happened for all us.
[09/10/2023, 3:07:11 PM] ~ Akshay: In any case I applied for multiple entries and they gave me for the next 6 months.
[09/10/2023, 3:07:33 PM] ~ Akshay: The same had happened for @917094296933 in this group.
[09/10/2023, 3:12:19 PM] ~ Rohith Polisetty: According to automatic extension, u will granted single entry visa till Nov 9th. So, if u leave Israel, this visa will become void. 
In the meantime, if u approach ministry of Interior with appropriate documents and apply for multiple entry, then u can go and come back freely.
I did got the single entry permission till March 30, and have required documents for extension. But, I didn't approach ministry of entry for multiple entry. So, if i leave directly to India, I have to apply again freshly.

[11/10/2023, 5:12:04 PM] ~ Apurva: I travelled to Ben Gurion today, to return to Mumbai (Ethiopian airlines to Addis Ababa, connecting to Mumbai). 

This might be of some help:
Overall, there was nothing unusual about getting to Ben Gurion, the security, and all airport procedures.
I took the bus ( at 5am) to Haifa Center Hashmona (5.50 am) , and train to Ben Gurion. Everything worked as usual.
Flight status (cancelled/running) can be checked on the airport website. Traffic at the airport is the usual, not too many/few people. There is no panic.

I'm at Addis Ababa now, waiting for the Mumbai flight. A connecting flight to Delhi just left a while ago. So, looks like Ethiopian is fine (as of today).
[11/10/2023, 5:13:38 PM] ~ Ashwini Krishna: Thanks for sharing!
[11/10/2023, 5:36:42 PM] ~ Shalini Dimri-Wagh: Thank you Apurva… your review is very much appreciated…. Have a safe flight 🙏

[12/10/2023, 11:59:28 PM] ~ Akshay: Any such line wasn't mentioned in today's email. Moreover the bus left at 3:30.
[12/10/2023, 11:59:53 PM] ~ Pankaj Prajapati: Nothing, I think they are just cross checking for some peoples.
[13/10/2023, 12:00:17 AM] ~ Nirman Chakraborty: From where bus will leave?
[13/10/2023, 12:00:27 AM] ~ To@yel: Today, the buses came late.l and we started around 3:45pm. But they already arrived around 4:45pm way before the reporting time. Hopefully 3 pm is okay.

So all are being thrown to garbage. If someone (also ask your friends) staying here and willing to take those food items please let me know. *It's food items afterall!*
[13/10/2023, 12:20:18 AM] ~ Mohit: Guys I had a thought, some of us are living outside Technion. I want to help Israeli citizens who have been displaced from the south. If we can do so please let me know. I will continue paying the rent.

[13/10/2023, 7:13:35 AM] ~ Sourav Bhowmick: They have asked to take us to their studio also. We said no and went from there

[13/10/2023, 9:11:57 AM] ~ Rajiv Mishra: Me and Manish are going to Delhi by Ethiopian Airlines today. We both got the confirmation email from embassy people. We have already informed the people at embassy. It might be a good idea to talk to them and directly refer to empty slots available for those who are still waiting for this opportunity.
[13/10/2023, 9:19:20 AM] ~ Yogendra Kumar: As my personal opinion, at least some of you have to do interviews and request to government, rescue remains as soon as possible. Thank you 🙏

[13/10/2023, 10:31:17 AM] ~ To@yel: To all the international students who are flying back to their homes- if you have here food and groceries that you wouldn't need anymore, there's a box in student union that collects food that doesn't require cooling to donate to soldiers and to civilians from the south who needed to evacuate. They also collect hygienic products and clothes so everything that wasn't used and you don't need anymore is welcome.
Have a safe travel 🙏🏻
[13/10/2023, 10:32:16 AM] ~ To@yel: Guys, you can drop those excess food here. Thanks!

[13/10/2023, 3:19:32 PM] ~ Azad Saini: Shall we fill this?
[13/10/2023, 3:19:36 PM] Sriman: Students who are currently staying abroad or who wish to go abroad due to the war situation are of course entitled to do so. Those who wish to continue their studies from abroad for a limited period of one semester should arrange this by submitting the following documents to the Graduate School via the Graduate School Secretary of their academic unit (this can also be done from abroad): • A letter of request, including reference to timetables and research milestones.  • Advisor's recommendation and confirmation that the research may be continued temporarily while abroad. • For Master's students who are required to take courses – Advisor's approval and Vice Dean approval regarding a feasible possibility for course studies from abroad, or alternatively, submission of a study program that does not include courses during 2023-24 Winter semester. • Advisor's and Vice Dean's recommendation for awarding a scholarship for the period abroad (if there is an intention to award it). Alternatively, one can request to hold the scholarship payments, or request an academic leave for the entire 2023-24 Winter semester. Such requests will be submitted through the department using the usual protocol and will be processed as quickly as possible. Due to the situation, the restrictions that normally apply to academic leave approvals will be reconsidered. It is important to note that the procedures appearing in this section refer to active students who have already begun their studies. The possibility of aadjusting and applying them to new students who are supposed to begin their studies in the winter semester 2023/2024 but are currently abroad is being examined. Guidelines regarding this option it will be published in the coming days.
[13/10/2023, 3:20:39 PM] ~ Samrat Chakraborty: Does anyone have any idea who is nodal person directly in contact with the embassy from Technion

[13/10/2023, 3:37:20 PM] ~ Samrat Chakraborty: It's strange. We have been constantly asked to contact the modal person to the Indian Embassy here in Technion and nobody knows about it!
[13/10/2023, 3:38:11 PM] ~ Samrat Chakraborty: I believe many of the students here in Technion are yet to be evacuated from Israel. If we are not getting the link/file to provide our details
It's high time request the embassy directly

[13/10/2023, 3:44:57 PM] Antara🧡❣️: This
[13/10/2023, 3:49:27 PM] ~ Samrat Chakraborty: We should take headcounts of students stuck in Technion
And send it to the embassy directly. I think this is the only way left.
[13/10/2023, 3:49:41 PM] Smriti Bhardwaj: ‎This message was deleted.
[13/10/2023, 3:50:24 PM] Smriti Bhardwaj: *‘I request everyone to please fill this out’*
I will send to Mr. Vishal Jyoti

[13/10/2023, 3:52:56 PM] ~ Samrat Chakraborty: It's high time the students and technion should convey it to the embassy

Lets see the remaining head count
[13/10/2023, 3:53:05 PM] ~ Samrat Chakraborty: Stuck students*

[13/10/2023, 3:54:27 PM] Smriti Bhardwaj: Send her number
[13/10/2023, 3:54:36 PM] ~ Addy: I think there is a need to create a pressure on the embassy to fasten the evacuation process by assigning more number aircrafts. While it's commendable that they already worked and did a lot, but the need of the hour is really to accelerate the evacuation by increasing the number of flights so that all of the students get evacuated by tommorow atleast . To do this someone has to tweet this issue to the foreign minister,and it will be better if someone who is left at Technion could do it and others retweet that .

[13/10/2023, 4:02:19 PM] ~ Addy: If u feel doing so is correct then do it. But procedure is not gonna make it fast and seeing the present scenario the intention is to save lives by not getting late.If tweeting is not a good option that seem to work then we must think about something else that could work in a more euphimistic way. But definitely pressure needs to be created as a whole.

My concern is that if the conflict spreads to the north (which it unfortunately already has I think)...then the rockets launched from there have range to hit Haifa and I honestly don't know whether to return or cancel my return flight because we've been through rocket attacks in the past but this time, it's a lot different

Many of us are likely to receive notifications regarding our upcoming flights shortly, as we have already completed our registration on the embassy portal. I would like to provide an additional link specifically intended for individuals who have previously filled out the last Google sheet. It is important to note that this document is not officially issued by the embassy; . Should the embassy request this information from us, we should be ready with an accurate headcount. I kindly request you people to complete the provided form-(only write yes if you were contacted by the embassy/email with the coming flight details)
[13/10/2023, 8:17:21 PM] ~ Samrat Chakraborty: Just write yes.
No need to say no here
[13/10/2023, 8:19:46 PM] ~ Shubham B. Deshmukh: I spoke to the ambassador 
He said that they will make sure everyone who is on the list will get confirmation soon and there will be another flight on Sunday. 
They are even trying to make two flights each day, but this is not definite. 
So overall, let us not worry as long as we have sent our list.

It may give happiness and maybe good memory to them. I don’t mean to cross the rules of the groups, I never shared any unnecessary messages till now, you can check. Maybe it’s a wrong time, I can understand, sorry for that. 

In addition to this, Head of Indian Israel embassy has asked to share not to panic but to be confident as they are planning to evacuate within four or five days. He has given this assurance. Be strong guys and stay safe. ‎<This message was edited>

[14/10/2023, 1:12:39 AM] ~ Samrat Chakraborty: Hi. Apparently a huge communication is going on regarding the flight timings. Do check with the embassy people about your flight timings to avoid any kinds of conflict.
[14/10/2023, 1:14:16 AM] ~ Samrat Chakraborty: As per my understanding
There will be 2 flights. One at 5pm and another at 10pm. Those who will be taking the 10pm flight for them there is transportation available from the technician at 3pm

Unfortunately for the people who will be taking 5pm flight there are no shuttle from Technion. So you have to arrange it in your own
[14/10/2023, 1:15:34 AM] ~ Samrat Chakraborty: I need to have the headcount of the people who will be catching the 10pm flight. So that we can inform the appropriate authority for the shuttle

We have the shuttle for us at 3pm
[14/10/2023, 1:16:34 AM] ~ Ashish Tiwari: I just called embassy and asked about the timing. They said 22:00 spice jet is confirmed and all the mails sent are correct.

[24/10/2023, 6:46:17 PM] ~ Shubham B. Deshmukh: Hi all
I would like to talk about two issues. 
First, the Technion Indians group is a not just a place to send information. It is a group that was started to have a place to support each other. Support each other because we all are on the same page. That we have left our homes behind and have made new relations in a foreign country. I think many people will agree that the Technion is among very few institution in the world where the Indian student population is very dense. And this gives us an advantage to live like one large family. So, let us remember this advantage and also remember that everybody here is to help each each other. 
The help and care we have for each was undoubtedly shown since the evacuation flights started. It was possible because this group stayed true to its purpose of “Technion Indians”. We worked like ONE UNIT one FAMILY. 
Secondly, it is not the first time that the group has faced problems because of political arguments. 
These arguments have always ended with a bad feeling for those directly involved and other members of the group. 
So, it is important that we voluntarily switch to private chats when we have political arguments. 
Today, this suggestion was given more than once. And it was ignored twice. 
However, this time one of the individuals involved in today’s argument messaged me privately to know my political opinion.
I would like to clear that my political opinion does not matter at all. My only opinion is that we must make sure that we use this group to help and care for each other. 
We must make sure we have an uninterrupted platform to share crucial information. 
Especially now, when all of us are in the same crisis.

Hello Everyone,
Following up on my last message regarding this, I am happy to announce that this issue has been discussed within a govt. scientific agency, and we have been asked to provide further data that can be used to setup communication between the interested students and relevant stakeholders.

[08/11/2023, 3:41:32 PM] ~ bbharath: Thank you! My visa ends on November 25.. I'm in India now.. I'm advised by the staff that extension is possible only from the office in Israel.. and that I'll have to apply for a fresh visa if I continue to stay in India.. ‎<This message was edited>
[08/11/2023, 3:44:23 PM] ~ bbharath: Is it advisable to travel to haifa for this now? 

If I decide to apply for a fresh visa from Delhi, what are the chances of it getting rejected due to the war situation?
[08/11/2023, 3:50:53 PM] ~ D: Yes you can travel to Haifa. It's hard to predict if the situation will worsen at the northern border. I presume there will be some delay in obtaining the visa due to the present crisis.
[08/11/2023, 3:51:20 PM] ~ Baja: As far as I know, they probably have extended the validity of your visa electronically. If so, there won't be any problem in entering Israel.
[08/11/2023, 3:52:38 PM] ~ D: Even if they automatically extended the visa, you cannot simply use a text message to enter Israel. You need valid visa on your passport. Saying this from personal experience in other countries.
[08/11/2023, 3:53:54 PM] ~ Baja: I would suggest you check with Michal regarding the extension of validity electronically
[08/11/2023, 3:56:25 PM] ~ bbharath: Thank you! I was informed that the extension was made only for single entry visas.. mine is a multiple entry visa..
[08/11/2023, 3:58:19 PM] ~ bbharath: I can travel to haifa till Nov. 25 to extend my visa.. but any thoughts on reapplying the visa from Delhi?
[08/11/2023, 3:59:18 PM] ~ D: You can come back if you like...You can reapply at Delhi but the processing might be delayed .
[08/11/2023, 3:59:51 PM] ~ bbharath: Thank you so much😊
[08/11/2023, 4:00:25 PM] ~ D: No worries...I think it's about time we slowly get back to our work. This crisis will not end anytime soon :(
[08/11/2023, 4:05:37 PM] ~ bbharath: The situation is really depressing.. hoping for a better tomorrow..

Does anybody know how much FlyDubai charge for extra check-in weight?
[08/11/2023, 4:46:31 PM] ~ .: Hi Reena. Just sharing my experience. I chose Ethiopian airlines to return to Israel on 13th Oct. Had a 6.5 hr layover in Ethiopia. I did not need any transit visa.

[09/11/2023, 8:39:07 AM] ~ Morningstar: Half minute ? nope. you need to change terminal from 3 to 2
[09/11/2023, 8:39:19 AM] ~ Morningstar: you need at least 3 hours
[09/11/2023, 8:39:44 AM] ~ Samrat Chakraborty: I think she tried to say hours! Not min
[09/11/2023, 8:40:17 AM] ~ Morningstar: Even 2:30 hours is risky.
[09/11/2023, 8:41:13 AM] ~ Mohit: If it's T3 no need to worry but if terminal changes you can use metro inside airport. But it's better to have more time
[09/11/2023, 8:43:12 AM] Rutvija: Okay thank you so much
[09/11/2023, 8:44:46 AM] Rutvija: But I dont have flydubai flight for more layover 😅
[09/11/2023, 8:45:14 AM] ~ Akshay: Whosoever flies to TLV in next coming days, please share ur experiences and the mode of travel. It would be really helpful to all others.
[09/11/2023, 9:05:43 AM] ~ Tanmoy Kundu: I think u need not go for immigration check, baggage collection and baggage check-in in Dubai.
In that case 2.5 hrs is more than sufficient even though u hv to change the terminal.
[09/11/2023, 9:06:46 AM] Rutvija: Okay thank you so much
[09/11/2023, 9:30:38 AM] Sriman: No it's self transfer so baggage collection and check-in is there
[09/11/2023, 9:34:59 AM] ~ RaNu: It's self transfer so you don't have to collect your  big luggage at Dubai and will directly get at Tel Aviv. However handbags will be checked before you get inside the gate at Dubai.
[09/11/2023, 10:26:09 AM] ~ Morningstar: If self transfer is there then you have to collect the luggage and check in again, in that case you need visa as well. So check before you proceed finally, if you have Etihad or flydubai flights then you can pay at indian airport to get your baggage tagged to tel aviv.
[09/11/2023, 10:53:42 AM] ~ RaNu: If you booked two separate flights then yes, physically transfer the luggage. If it's a connecting flight and booked as a single itinerary airline will transfer it.
